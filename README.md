## Olea

Olea is a mobile app that parses recipes from blogs, social media, and images, then restructures them into a clean cooking workflow. It supports ingredient substitutions, serving-size scaling, grocery list generation, and smart UI for step-by-step cooking.

The app is built with React Native and Expo on the frontend, an Express and Supabase backend, and a multi-stage parsing pipeline that combines HTML extraction, LLM interpretation, and caching.

Features
- Recipe parsing from URLs, text, and short-form video captions
- Ingredient scaling and appropriate substitutions
- Instruction rewriting
- Grocery list generation
- Clean cooking step navigation for cooking
- Supabase auth (Apple native and Google OAuth) and storage
